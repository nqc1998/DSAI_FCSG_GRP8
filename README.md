## Welcome to students’ dropout rate and academic success prediction

### About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on students’ dropout rate predictions in university. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Exploration
4. Model
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. Logistic Regression
8. K Nearest Neighbor
9. Naive Bayes

@lhm - Model (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
@chengrui - Data Exploration, K Nearest Neighbor
@nqc - Data Visualization, Data Extraction, Naive Bayes

### Problem Definition
- Uses historical data and relevant predictors to accurately identify students at risk of dropping out from an educational institution
- Develop and Choose the best model to predict it.

### Models Used
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. K Nearest Neighbor
5. Naive Bayes

### Conclusion
- We unexpectedly found that older students and male students face higher danger of dropout
- Random Forest is best model as it has highest accuracy(0.87), precision (0.86), recall(0.73)
- We learnt other models including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes
- Educational institution can use the model to identify students at risk of dropping out
- Provide more financial aid, academic support, counselling and advising to the group of students 

### What did we learn from this project?
- Application for different models
- Cross Validation
- Feature Engineering
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
